# DSA101
Repository for DSA101 exercises (UZH DSA minor)

There are some exercises to get started and to introduce specific concepts, and a simulation to try out collaborative coding with git.

Module coordinator and main instructor: Prof. Alexandria Deliz Liang

Co-instructor: Prof. Meredith C. Schuman

## Important!
You will need to use Git and GitHub.
Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a free program that provides a convenient interface to interact with Git while coding and accessing files in your repository. It is a nice tool to get started.
However, you can also choose to use the command line, GitHub GUI, or GitHub Desktop to interact with Git, and do your coding and run the exercises in your preferred coding interface (e.g. using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab via Anaconda).
